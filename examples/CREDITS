P.S. Please bug Adam if you should be on this list but are not...

3. Dedication

This software is dedicated to those individuals behind Internet sites everywhere --
working frantically behind-the-scenes to implement, test, and operate their site
in a world where a "store" that's only open from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, in any time zone,
is a "store" that's out of business.

I'd like to especially thank those in the Technology department of Orbitz, Inc.
without whose patience and support this project simply would not be possible.
