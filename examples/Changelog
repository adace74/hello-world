Change List For v0.3 (Language: Perl / Status: Shipped)
-------------------------------------------------------
* Some semblance of a shell, include a useful prompt.
  Now includes 'cat', 'cd', and 'ls' for local server browsing.
* Ability to load in text-based lists of servers, representing
  server sets.
* Ability to load in different remote usernames for different server sets
  from a text file.
  (i.e. apache@web01, tomcat@app01)
* Ability to work with -one- environment of servers at a time,
  specified at startup via --env=my_environment.
  The idea here is not allow users to mix devel, testing, and production worlds.
* Attempts to connect to all servers port 22, -before- running ssh.
  This health-check prevents "session hang" that can occur by running
  ssh alone.
* Single remote server command execution.
* Multiple set-based remote server command execution.
* Pattern-based group and server name matching for the lazy sysadmin
  in all of us.

Change List For v0.4-v0.45 (Language: Perl / Status: Shipped)
-------------------------------------------------------------
* Addition of the "login" command.  Basically allows the user to specify
  a server to login to without having to exit the distribulator.
* Addition of --noping for environments where either a ServerPing is
  undesirable or the installed version of Net::Ping is out-of-date.
* Addition of the "all" server group.  This will allow one to run any command
  across every group in the started-up environment.
* Addition of the ability to read in a text-file list of common Unix commands.
* Addition of the ability to distinguish those commands as external and
  simply pass them through to the underlying shell via the system() call.

Change List For v0.47 (Language: Perl / Status: Shipped)
--------------------------------------------------------
* Modularized codebase.  Still not all that generic, but at least
  broken out by functionality.  There's still way too many
  inter-dependancies, but it's at least more manageable.
* Various fixes, including that of the Net::Ping code,
  no CPAN module addon required.  Removed --noping as the underlying
  assumption behind it is not valid.
* Term::ReadLine::GNU & GNU libreadline are now required for this
  software to perform correctly(or even run it seems).
* Lots of GNU libreadline functionality: history load/save,
  tab-completion of first word command, some CTRL-C / CTRL-D integration.
* Crude attempts to fix problems relating to running distribulator,
  then exiting and having one's term act very flakey.
* Added ability to abort a command while executing on X servers.
  (Hold down CTRL-C, or just hit it a number of times)
* Improved testing process, thus improved stability.

Change List For v0.48 (Language: Perl / Status: Shipped)
--------------------------------------------------------
* Fixed a silly bug where the command-line prompt wasn't being updated with
  the current server group.
* Added a -t flag to the run command.  This will allow one to specify
  whether a remote tty is required for a given command.  This has caused
  much pain within my work environment lately.  Use with caution, some
  programs/scripts require -t (i.e. vi) and some will utterly break on
  Linux if given -t (i.e. some custom startup scripts).
* Fixed the included wrapper script such that it stores the user's
  pwd on startup, then passes it along to the distribulator such that
  the module directory magic going is transparent.
* Fixed code to ignore 'CVS' directories.

Change List For v0.5 (Language: Python / Bloat Factor: 1787 lines / Status: Shipped)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* First 100% Python release.  Enjoying the benefits of a more
  natively object-oriented language than Perl.
* All previous Perl features implemeneted, some better than before.
* Auditing implemented.
* Batch mode implemented.
* XML config implemented.
* Single local server file to single group server file copy.
(i.e. scp awd@localhost:/tmp/blah awd@app:/some/other/path)

Change List For v0.51 (Language: Python / Bloat Factor: 1787 lines / Status: Shipped)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Lots of documentation updates,
  aiming for the normal INSTALL/README paradigm.

Change List For v0.52 (Language: Python / Bloat Factor: 1819 lines / Status: Shipped)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Changed command "server-group" with no arguments to print
  a server-group list similar to that at startup.
* Fixed inaccuracies found in this Changelog.
* SourceForge bug #744225 fixed.
* SourceForge bug #744226 fixed.
* SourceForge bug #749953 fixed.
* SourceForge bug #749963 fixed.

Change List For v0.53 (Language: Python / Bloat Factor: Unknown / Status: Skipped)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Minimal cosmetic fixes in how server-list and server-group
  do output.

Change List For v0.6.0 (Language: Python / Bloat Factor: 2503 lines / Status: Shipped)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Goal: The ongoing goal of this release is to provide a "good enough"
  featureset for real-world applications, and to implement a
  feature freeze such that focus can be shifted to stability
  and correctness issues.
* Batch Mode: Addition of --quiet flag to indicate we don't want output when
  run in batch mode.  The default now is to NOT be quiet.
* Batch Mode: Addition of comment(#) and line(\) continuation compatability.
  This will only allow comments to be on a single line, by themselves.
* Batch Mode: Addition of --var1, --var2, and --var3, which enable very
  simple string substitution such that batch files don't have to be
  completely hard-coded.  Also added $env as a built-in variable.
* Batch Mode: Addition of a quiet-mode-aware pretty header and footer.
  Footer includes command count tracking and a very simple time statistics
  summary.
* Addition of the ability to run commands on a single server,
  list of multiple servers, single server group,
  as well as multiple server groups.
* Addition of the ability to copy files(one-way for right now) from
  a local server out to a single server, list of multiple servers,
  single server group, as well as multiple server groups.
* Addition of a valid XML DTD, such that one can use readily-available
  XML validators to verify that config.xml has no syntax errors,
  spelling mistakes(in tags), etc.  Verified example config.xml
  actually validates via a standard XML validator.
* Removed short version of option flags.  They've outlived their
  usefullness and have become more effort than they're worth.
* Documentation system-wide has been updated to reflect new features added.
  Also started the process of standardizing comments within the sourcecode.
* Lots of little bugs were found and fixed along the way.
  For details see Sourceforge, there are simply too many to list here.
* Small LICENSE fixes, also propogated other legalese.

Change List For v0.6.1 (Language: Python / Bloat Factor: 2940 lines / Status: Shipped)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Finally got around to parameterizing the application version info.
* Added source-level documentation to the codebase(pydoc compatible).
* Various clean-up across the codebase.
* Addition of the ability to specify a config file via the --config
  flag.
* Addition of the ability to use the local username remotely,
  when there are no "username" attributes found in config.xml.
* SourceForge bug #776079 fixed.
* SourceForge bug #787445 fixed.
* SourceForge bug #776080 fixed.
* SourceForge bug #774953 fixed.
* Standardized version numbering.
* Added a small script to automate release packaging.

Change List For v0.6.2 (Language: Python / Bloat Factor: 2951 lines / Status: Shipped)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* SourecForge bug #805371 fixed.
* SourceForge bug #815787 fixed.
* SourceForge bug #815788 fixed.
* SourceForge bug #815877 fixed.

Change List For v0.6.3 (Language: Python / Bloat Factor: 3157 lines / Status: Shipped)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* SourceForge bug #845634 fixed.
* SourecForge bug #853052 fixed.
* Ability to simply echo any given set of hosts or server groups to STDOUT
  in a space-delimited format acceptable to other languages(i.e. shell/Perl)
  that is also easily passable to SSH.
* Cleanup: Renaming instance variables with a naming convention less lame than
  thisThing, thisOtherThing, etc.

Change List For v0.7.0 (Language: Python / Bloat Factor: 3478 lines / Status: Shipped)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Cleanup: Restructured and "split up" code such that it adheres to a more
  OO way of thinking.  No real definition of dynamic versus static classes,
  but at least there are less monolithic classfiles now.
* Cleanup: Examined all source files, eliminated extraneous imports
  where possible.
* Cleanup: Updated pydoc-based documentation to reflect above changes.
* Testing: Improved the existing manual test suite.
* Batch Mode: Added $hostname as a built-in variable, referencing the local server hostname.

Change List For v0.7.1 (Language: Python / Bloat Factor: 3646 lines / Status: Shipped)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Ability to "ping" servers via internal TCP check logic.
  Options include TCP port, timeout in secs, and a banner string contains "foo" check.
  NOTE: This appears to have sped up overall speed significantly.  Nice!
* Rename "server-group" command to "set server-group"
  and "server-list" command to "list server-group".
* Ability to use a new run command keyword: "single".
  This will copy or run a command to a single server within a group,
  skipping failed servers as necessary.
* Cleanup: Added a generic error message to the XMLConfigParser,
  should avoid some raw stack traces on missing XML tags.

Change List For v0.7.2 (Language: Python / Bloat Factor: 3655 lines / Status: Shipped)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Update all code to be functional with Python v2.3.X.
* Cleanup: Updated the accompanying config.dtd with the "ping" XML tag.
* Cleanup: Disable GNU readline history when running in batch mode.

Change List For v0.7.3 (Language: Python / Bloat Factor: 3642 lines / Status: Skipped)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Change List For v0.7.4 (Language: Python / Bloat Factor: 3773 lines / Status: Shipped)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Ability to specify per-servergroup SSH version for use with both
  "copy" and "run" commands.  If no version is specified, no extra flags are added.
* Cleanup: Moved CTRL-C state info into GlobalConfig.py.
  This allows us to quickly dump out of batch mode when one hits CTRL-C.
* Cleanup: Added code to batch mode to close STDIN, should help with backgrounding.
* Cleanup: Made the batch mode header and footer output more concise.

Change List For v0.7.5 (Language: Python / Bloat Factor: 3963 lines / Status: Shipped)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Cleanup: Changed exception handling for socket timeout to avoid stack trace dump.
* Cleanup: Changed readline code to filename-only tab completion.
* Cleanup: Disabled "copy" command local filesystem check so regular expressions can be used.
* Cleanup: Added ping checks to ListMode.  All servers now returned are guaranteed up.
* Cleanup: Converted logging from ever-so-slow syslog to the new logging module.
  All parameters such as filename, level, date format, and log format are now configurable.
* Ability to set and show a global delay for sleep()ing between remote commands.
  Basically this allows one to "slow things down" if desired.
* Ability to have two permutations of list mode.
  The first returns only hostnames, the second returns username@hostname pairs.

Change List For v0.8.0 (Language: Python / Bloat Factor: 3944 lines / Status: Shipped)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Ability to ignore username information in config.xml via --nouser command-line flag.
* Ability to skip the are-you-sure questions via the "now" keyword.
* Ability to use logging module's configuration file for ultra-flexible logging setup.
  As a result of this change, the --quiet flag has been replaced by the --verbose flag.

Change List For v0.8.5 (Language: Python / Bloat Factor: 3983 lines / Status: Shipped)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Cleanup: Changed logging.conf to utilize in-memory buffering for high-volume logging.
* Cleanup: Reordered the global config object, attempted to organize variables better.
* Transfer of all copyright notices from personal to Orbitz corporate.
* Ability to use regular expressions in the "run" command.

Change List For v0.9.0 (Codename: Final Run / Bloat Factor: 4327 lines / Status: Shipped)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Cleanup: Added an autoconf script such that no matter where the package is installed
  or where Python is, we'll run with it.
* Cleanup: Replaced all highly unreadable "&" "|" characters with keyword equivalents.
* Cleanup: Replaced all less readable "foo == FALSE" clauses with "not foo" equivalents.
* Cleanup: Added logic to pre-check config.xml for well-formedness before actual parsing.
* SourceForge bug #1118162 fixed.
* Ability to load all environments at startup, then switch environments at runtime via "set environment".
* Ability to use regular expressions in the "copy" command.
* Cleanup: Various console mode output tweaks.

Change List For v0.9.1 (Codename: One More Time / Bloat Factor: 4457 lines / Status: Shipped)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Cleanup: Removed a needless directory flag and replaced this with a more elegant solution.
* Cleanup: Replaced GNU autoconf-based installer with Python's distutils setup.py.
* SourceForge bug #1231297 fixed.

Change List For v0.9.2 (Codename: Cleanliness / Bloat Factor: 4099 lines / Status: Shipped)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Cleanup: Updated the new setup.py scheme to be more developer-friendly.
* Cleanup: Changed the logging of downed nodes from an "error" to a "warning".
* Clenaup: Various small logging changes to make output more readable.
* Preliminary threading support added, but not active by default.

Change List For v0.9.3 (Codename: Cleanliness / Bloat Factor: 4102 lines / Status: Shipped)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* SourceForge Bug #1250465 fixed.

Change List For v1.0.0 (Codename: Porcine Catapult / Bloat Factor: 4154 lines / Status: Shipped)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Cleanup: Remove trailing whitespaces for almost all files.
* Modified configuration XML schema to support more consistent attributes,
  as well as dynamic attribute support.
* Added preliminary support for attribute-based selction in "copy", "run", and "show" meta-commands.
* Added preliminary support for attribute-based selection in list mode.

Change List For v1.0.1 (Codename: Tranquility / Bloat Factor: 4567 lines / Status: Shipped)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Cleanup: Changed batch and list modes to not throw ERRORs when a non-existant server group is specified.
           This makes it easier to maintain shared code across environments of varied size.
* Cleanup: Changed the 'set server-group' command to simply reject attribute specifications.
           This was acting oddly previously, resulting in confusing / potentially dangerous behavoir. 
* Added pingtcp.py script, a very handy tool for checking whether servers are alive...or not.
* Added sniper.py script, a very handy tool for selectively killing processes in a mission critical environment.

Change List For v1.1.0 (Codename: Optimator / Status: Not Started)
------------------------------------------------------------------
- Stable ability to use a new run command keyword: "threads".
  This will run the given command in background processes in parallel.
  Output will be spooled to one file per server in a standard output directory.
- Ability to use a "set concurrency X" command to set the concurrency
  for parallel run.  Also XML config directives for global defaults.

Change List For v1.2.0 (Codename: Status / Status: Not Started)
---------------------------------------------------------------
? Ability to have "pluggable" transports whereby one can at least use the "copy" and "run" commands
  via rsh, ssh, SSL, multicast, etc.  Will most likely use command-line as interface.

Small Feature TODO
------------------
- Server groups of server groups.
- Cleanup: Provide a larger set of example files.  Double-check doc.  Test like crazy.
- Ability to have batch mode report back with names of servers down and how many during a given run.
- Ability to run multiple commands using typical shell-style semicolon delimiter.

Large Feature TODO
------------------
- Ability to use "set password", along with password echo with or without remote sudo functionality.
- Ability to list servers who run a particular service.  Config file tags, etc.
- Installer: Using python's distuitls package, create a sane installer.
- Multiple remote server file to local file copy.  This would have to somehow
  rename the files as it copies them down, perhaps based on hostname prefix.
  (i.e. scp awd@www01,www02,www03:/tmp/blah .)
- Single remote server file to single remote server file copy.
  (i.e. scp awd@www01:/tmp/blah awd@www02:/some/other/path/)
- Single remote server file to multiple remote servers file copy.
  (i.e. scp awd@www01:/tmp/blah awd@www01,www02,www03:/some/other/path/)
- Testing: Completion of a comprehensive batch file test suite.

Other Ideas
-----------
- A server mode in which the distribulator will check an incoming command
  queue(a file or two?) then run those on what it considers to be its
  siblings.  This would allow commands and files to be routed to
  X number of servers in a speedy fashion.
