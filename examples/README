What Is It?
-----------
The Distribulator concept arised after working with an environment
consisting of over 750 servers, in a company where there aren't nearly
that many employees total -- much less just to maintain servers!

The Distribulator is a longer-term project whose goal is to provide
cluster management functionality to "the rest of us" not running
custom clustered OS-level software.  It aims to solve the widest range
of problems with the least amount of code / complexity.

Currently, the Distribulator has three modes:

* Batch: A batch mode that's handy in a number of situations ranging
  from repeatable tasks to complete hand-off of logic from one group
  of people to another.

* Console: A console interface designed to "wrap" around SSH,
  but will also allow local commands to be run.  The idea here is to provide
  people who have to do command-level maintenance / "fire fights" in a
  production environment with the simplest common toolset available.
  (Has anyone seen better?  If so, please let me know!)

* List: A list mode suitable to retrieving set lists of servers or server groups,
  with the goal of easy for loop iteration from shell scripts, Perl code, etc.

The software also comes with a some "training wheel"-style features:

* Built-in "environment blinders" such that by definition one cannot corrupt
  Environment A by attempting to perform operations on Environment B.
  Hopefully this can avoid problems that sound like this -- "Oh crap!  That was production?"

* Built-in, but overridable "Are you sure?" prompts are automatically inserted
  into all console-mode commands.

What Will It Do?
----------------
Many things.  Please see the "Changelog" file located in this directory.

How do I install it?
--------------------
Please see the "INSTALL" file located in this directory.

How stable is it?
-----------------
By the time releases are posted on SourceForge, they've typically been in multiple test environments
for roughly 2 weeks performing real-world tasks.  As they say, however, Your Milage May Vary.

What are the known bugs?
------------------------
Please see the Sourceforge project site, click on the "Bugs" link.

Where can I read more extensive documentation?
----------------------------------------------
Sorry, but for the moment the most extensive documentation can be found
by running "distribulator.py --help" and using the "help" command
once the console mode has started properly.

Who Is Working On It?
