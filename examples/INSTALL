Installing The Distribulator
----------------------------

Prerequisites
-------------
Before installing the distribulator, one must have already installed a copy of the following:

- A Unix-like OS.

The usual suspects.  *BSD, Linux, Solaris, etc.

- Recommended: GNU Readline v4.3 or later (http://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/~chet/readline/rltop.html)

Since the software uses the Python readline module pretty extensively, we need this.

- Recommended: OpenSSH v3.4p1 or later (http://www.openssh.org/)

Taking the lead from the FreeBSD project, this is the version of SSH that the software has been tested with.
It handles SSH v1/v2 very well, and there have been no major problems found so far.

- Recommended: Python v2.3.4 or later (http://www.python.org/) accessible in your shell path.

I give no guarantee this software will work with earlier versions.
This also provides a sane yardstick to measure by in the case of problems.

Developer Installation
----------------------
1) CVS checkout the source, via anonymous or secured means.
2) make symlink
3) ./bin/distribulator

User Installation
-----------------
1) Pick a place you'd like to install the program.
   Please don't use the "setup.py" default path...that hasn't been tested!

   For the sake of example, let's say you have Python installed as /usr/bin/python2.3
   and you want to install this software into /apps/distribulator2

2) Go to the subdir of where you typically keep source code:
   cd ~/src/

3) Unpack the distribution:
   tar xfz distribulator-X.X.X.tar.gz

4) Run setup.py:
   cd distribulator-X.X.X
   python setup.py install --prefix=/apps/distribulator2

5) Add the directory /apps/distribulator2/bin/ to your path.  (optional)

6) Fire it up:
   distribulator.py --env=demo

7) Test it out, tinker around, read the next section for how to setup config.xml for your environments.

Configuration Overview
----------------------
This file won't go into extensive detail on the configuration files listed here,
however you'll at least have a starting point.

conf/config.xml -- Main XML configuration file.

This file contains all configure settings except logging.
Includes binary locations, server and server group settings, etc.
Most likely this will be the file of most interest to you.

Settings of interest:
- Binary locations for logname, scp, and ssh.
- Host Pinger options.
- Server environment(s) and group(s) settings.

conf/logging.conf -- Logging configuration file.

This file contains all configuration relating to logging.
Please keep in mind the fact that we consider STDOUT to be just another log destination.
See the Python "logging" module documentation for more details.

conf/pass_through_cmds.txt -- Pass-through commands list.

This file contains a simple list of Unix common commands for the command-line interface to "pass through",
that is to simply run locally as a good shell should.

examples/ -- Directory containing example batch files that should work if configuration is setup properly.
