## What Is It?
After looking around the Internet a bit, I couldn't quite find a Java library
that suits my needs.  This is an attempt to build a somewhat lightweight,
console-oriented library.

## What Will It Do?
Right now, I'm just getting started in terms of development.

Features will include:
* 100% Pure Java
* Suitable for use if one wanted to write a MySQL or Oracle SQL shell.
* Support for command history, arrow-key retrieve, etc.
* Support for control keys.
* That's about it.

## How Do I install It?
Installation instructions will be forthcoming.

## Who Is Working On It?
Just me at the moment.
